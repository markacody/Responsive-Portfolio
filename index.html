			<h1>About Me</h1>

			<img src="assets/images/selfportrait.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Mark Cody">

				<p>As a career educator, two questions summarize almost all that I do. <br><span class="pop">"How can this be easier?"</span> <br> <span class="pop">"How can this be fun?"</span></p><br>
				<p>With these questions in mind, I am an analyst, designer, and developer of solutions for learning, performance, and enhanced user experience.</p><br>
				<p><strong class="pop">Analyst</strong>. Analysis is about understanding the user experience. When it comes to the web and to information systems, a temptation is to limit analysis to a system and its user interface, but  experience is shaped by events that occur before, during, and after a transaction. 
				</p> <br>
				<p><strong class="pop">Designer</strong>. Stories and expectations matter. Impact is everything. A solution that takes hold and makes change is more than an app. It's a coordinated system of communications, events, and interactions. Design can lead to a better version of real life. More compelling too. 
				</p> <br>
				<p>
				<strong class="pop">Developer</strong>. In a small learning design shop, access to professional IT resources is limited, so I provide the web programming and back end skills. I am a User Experience Designer and Full Stack Web Developer. </p> <br>
